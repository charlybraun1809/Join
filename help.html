        <p>Welcome to the help page for <span style="color:#29abe2"> Join</span>, your guide to using our kanban project
            management tool. Here, we'll provide an overview of what <span style="color:#29abe2"> Join</span> is, how it
            can benefit you, and how to use it.</p>
        <h2>What is Join?</h2>
        <p><span style="color:#29abe2"> Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a
            group of dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.</p><br>
        <p>Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
            work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <span style="color:#29abe2"> Join</span> leverages the
            principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.</p>
        <br>
        <p>It is important to note that <span style="color:#29abe2"> Join</span> is designed as an educational exercise
            and is not intended for extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user
            experience, we cannot guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality
            regarding <span style="color:#29abe2"> Join</span>.</p>
        <h2>How to use it</h2>
        <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <span style="color:#29abe2"> Join</span>:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Exploring the Board</h3>
                When you log in to <span style="color:#29abe2"> Join</span>, you'll find a default board. This board
                represents your project and contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and
                "Done".
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Creating Contacts</h3>
                In <span style="color:#29abe2"> Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to
                the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these
                contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Adding Cards</h3>
                Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual tasks. Click
                the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the card,
                like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Moving Cards</h3>
                As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and dropping
                the card from one list to another.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Deleting Cards</h3>
                Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a card will
                permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action is
                irreversible.
            </li>
        </ol>
        Remember that using <span style="color:#29abe2"> Join</span> effectively requires consistent updates from you
        and your team to ensure the board reflects the current state of your project.<br>
